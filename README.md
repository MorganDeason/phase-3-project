# Introduction

In my past I spent a couple of years involved with wildland firefighting, and it left me with an interest that is still popping up in my head with every idea.  I continue to use this as an inspiration for projects and want to see what all I am able to do along the way.

## Sumamry

This is a dashboard I created for researching and learning about wildfires throughout history in the United States.

## Languages and Dependecies
    - Python
        -Dash
        -Flask
        -Pyproj
    
# Future Features
In the future I hope to have a much more interactive dashboard where where you can pull up more specific data about each fire by either clicking on the fire in the table or the fire on the map itself.  Along with that, I would like to have the perimeter of the fires show up on the map rather than just markers.

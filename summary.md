The initial intention for this project was to have a map and a table next to each other that would interact with each other .  You would be able to click on a fire on either the table or the map with the fires drawn out and the information about that fire would show up on both of the individual things.
    This turned out to far more challenging than I anticipated. Learning Dash and all of the tendencies it has was a fairly quick challenge to overcome.  Integrating a Folium map alongside it was a different story.  I discovered that the data that I was using, that I hoped would be useful in making the fire outlines show up on the map, was using a type of coordinate that I have never seen before and had no idea how to convert it.  So after a lot of struggling and trial and error I was able to get markers to show up but they werent in the area that they were supposed to be in.
    
    In the future I want to keep trying at the this. I do think that I should do a better job a vetting the data that I plan on using and make sure that it uses lat/long style of coordinates. Another possible thing that would help on my end would be to find a smaller data set to work with rather than the huge one that I was attempting to use.  

    All in all I enjoyed this project and have hopes for doing much more with it in the future.
